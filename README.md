- 👋 Hi, I’m @Geode-Hannah
- 👀 I’m interested in processing earthquake data for visualization in SEISAN, ObSpy, SeisComP, Earthworm, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data processing and MATLAB for simple visualizations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on processing data collected from RaspberryShake seismometer devices (and more).
- 📫 How to reach me 15hproff@ku.edu and 15hproff@gmail.com

<!---
My current project uses the RaspberryShake technology to remotely collect earthquake data from 5 seismic stations in the field.
I have built and installed each station myself and under the supervision of my advisor.
Each week, I collect the data via SFTP. However, I am almost finished with a script that will do the collection effortlessly.
Once the scrip it running, it will be posted under "pySFTP_RaspiShake", so keep an eye out for that.
For data processing, I plan to run code through Obspy for conversion. SEISAN will be used for event picking and plotting.
Reach out to me for any suggestions or concerns!

Cheers!
